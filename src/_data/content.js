Things you do should not be hard for you. This doesn't mean that you shouldn't work hard, but such work should come naturally to you. Live with compassion, sincerity and kindness.

    body: "Buddha was born as a prince. It was prophesised that he will either grow to be a great king or a spiritual leader. Legend has it - that as a toddler he spoke to his mum and said he will bring great things. Buddha was protected from the outside world darkness by his father - the things he would see would tend to be nice and beautiful. However, once he went outside and saw the poverty, death. This shocked him, to an extent that he has decided to give away his fortune and titles and set off to mountains. Years later he came back - enlightened and sharing wisdom with everyone else. Buddhism is based on 4 logisms: '1. Life is suffering. 2. Suffering comes from desire. 3. Get rid of desire and you will get rid of the suffering. 4. Buddhism is the path to help you achieve that'. Buddhists promote a modest life where a person dedicates themselves to self-development, analysis of scriptures, seeking the enlightment. The biggest sin in buddhism is to be ignorant. There is even an alegory to illustrate that: '6 blind men were around an elephant. None of them knew what an elephant was, but were told to describe it. One touched the sturdy said and said - it's a wall. Other touched the trunk and said it's like a snake. Third touched the ear and said it's a fan. Fourth touched a leg and called it a pillar. Fifth touched the tail and said it's a rope. Last one touched the tusk and said it's a spear'. The moral of the story - that describing individual parts won't matter until you combine it all - into one big picture. Buddhism promotes acceptance, open mindness, love for all. There are several forms of budhism. Mahayana - focuses on compassion and delays enlightment until all around has reached it - it even says that within every one of us there is Buddha and buddhahood can be achieved by everyone. Zen - elightment is to see extraordinary in the ordinary - even when it's achieved, nothing changes and life goes on - you just have a different perspective on it. The highest truth is inexpressable - no need to depend on words or letters. 'Buddha is 3 wax candles'. The highest knowledge is intituive. Radical religion inspired by buddhism claims that everything is alive (including substance). It was considered a massive sin to eat a fruit with seeds - every seed is its own living thing. This form of budism is called janizm. The three jewels of buddhism are: Buddha, the teachings of Buddha - Darma and Sangha - the longest existing community in the world (started from the start of buddhism). Rejected philosophy as a thing.",

He was looking for a job as advisor, but his direct tongue got in the way. He has said many phrases. For example: 'Learning without thought - pointless'. 'Thought without learning - dangerous'. 'You won't learn unless a thing to hold that you know it and when you don't - to allow that you don't know it'. 'To see what is right and not do it is the worst cowardice'. 'It does not matter how slowly you go, as long as you do not stop.' Confucius was the author of 'Do not do to others what you do not want done to yourself'. Woman insubordinance is hard to deal with: if you are too friendly to them - they take advantage of you, if you keep your distance - they resent it.",

Some thoughts can eixist without invoking experiences: intuitive (for example a contradiction: something can be and not be) or demonstrative (abstract proofs). We start with nothing and get everything through experience. You can either sense and experience an object or just experience it. Personal identity is a collection of experiences. Simple fundamental parts make a greater whole. Each object can be examined with a primary quality -  direct experiences (hardness, shape, weight) and secondary quality - subjective experiences, which will be different depending on the observer (color, tase, smell, texture). The difference between a thought and experience is that experience also includes a concept of space and time.",
