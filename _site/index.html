          data-full="Buddha was born as a prince. It was prophesised that he will either grow to be a great king or a spiritual leader. Legend has it - that as a toddler he spoke to his mum and said he will bring great things. Buddha was protected from the outside world darkness by his father - the things he would see would tend to be nice and beautiful. However, once he went outside and saw the poverty, death. This shocked him, to an extent that he has decided to give away his fortune and titles and set off to mountains. Years later he came back - enlightened and sharing wisdom with everyone else. Buddhism is based on 4 logisms: '1. Life is suffering. 2. Suffering comes from desire. 3. Get rid of desire and you will get rid of the suffering. 4. Buddhism is the path to help you achieve that'. Buddhists promote a modest life where a person dedicates themselves to self-development, analysis of scriptures, seeking the enlightment. The biggest sin in buddhism is to be ignorant. There is even an alegory to illustrate that: '6 blind men were around an elephant. None of them knew what an elephant was, but were told to describe it. One touched the sturdy said and said - it's a wall. Other touched the trunk and said it's like a snake. Third touched the ear and said it's a fan. Fourth touched a leg and called it a pillar. Fifth touched the tail and said it's a rope. Last one touched the tusk and said it's a spear'. The moral of the story - that describing individual parts won't matter until you combine it all - into one big picture. Buddhism promotes acceptance, open mindness, love for all. There are several forms of budhism. Mahayana - focuses on compassion and delays enlightment until all around has reached it - it even says that within every one of us there is Buddha and buddhahood can be achieved by everyone. Zen - elightment is to see extraordinary in the ordinary - even when it's achieved, nothing changes and life goes on - you just have a different perspective on it. The highest truth is inexpressable - no need to depend on words or letters. 'Buddha is 3 wax candles'. The highest knowledge is intituive. Radical religion inspired by buddhism claims that everything is alive (including substance). It was considered a massive sin to eat a fruit with seeds - every seed is its own living thing. This form of budism is called janizm. The three jewels of buddhism are: Buddha, the teachings of Buddha - Darma and Sangha - the longest existing community in the world (started from the start of buddhism). Rejected philosophy as a thing. The Buddha (Siddhartha Gautama) Wiki Religion, Ethics, Asia, East"

               Buddha was born as a prince. It was prophesised that he will either grow to be a great king or a spiritual leader. Legend has it - that as a toddler he spoke to his mum and said he will bring great things. Buddha was protected from the outside world darkness by his father - the things he would see would tend to be nice and beautiful. However, once he went outside and saw the poverty, death. This shocked him, to an extent that he has decided to give away his fortune and titles and set off to mountains. Years later he came back - enlightened and sharing wisdom with everyone else. Buddhism is based on 4 logisms: '1. Life is suffering. 2. Suffering comes from desire. 3. Get rid of desire and you will get rid of the suffering. 4. Buddhism is the path to help you achieve that'. Buddhists promote a modest life where a person dedicates themselves to self-development, analysis of scriptures, seeking the enlightment. The biggest sin in buddhism is to be ignorant. There is even an alegory to illustrate that: '6 blind men were around an elephant. None of them knew what an elephant was, but were told to describe it. One touched the sturdy said and said - it's a wall. Other touched the trunk and said it's like a snake. Third touched the ear and said it's a fan. Fourth touched a leg and called it a pillar. Fifth touched the tail and said it's a rope. Last one touched the tusk and said it's a spear'. The moral of the story - that describing individual parts won't matter until you combine it all - into one big picture. Buddhism promotes acceptance, open mindness, love for all. There are several forms of budhism. Mahayana - focuses on compassion and delays enlightment until all around has reached it - it even says that within every one of us there is Buddha and buddhahood can be achieved by everyone. Zen - elightment is to see extraordinary in the ordinary - even when it's achieved, nothing changes and life goes on - you just have a different perspective on it. The highest truth is inexpressable - no need to depend on words or letters. 'Buddha is 3 wax candles'. The highest knowledge is intituive. Radical religion inspired by buddhism claims that everything is alive (including substance). It was considered a massive sin to eat a fruit with seeds - every seed is its own living thing. This form of budism is called janizm. The three jewels of buddhism are: Buddha, the teachings of Buddha - Darma and Sangha - the longest existing community in the world (started from the start of buddhism). Rejected philosophy as a thing.

               A part of Socrates circle. The author of socratic dialogues (he claimed he marely documented Socrates, but he either lied or gave a good portion of himself). One of the first dramaturgs (tragedies). Acknowledged the duality of a person: a feeling, passionate person; a rational, thinking person. Passion is what motivates and sometimes it seems we do the unrational. Republic - tried to understand the civil morals, how a person ought to live, what it means and takes to be a good person, lead. Allegory of a cave: 'imagine being changed in a cave. In front of you - a wall. Behind you - light. As different objects pass by the light - you see a reflection - a shadow on the wall. It's not the reality itself - it's just a distortion of it'. If we had the power to turn invisible, no matter good or bad, we would all turn corrupt and do our own bidding.

              <span class="caption">A legendary sage, demi-human. He is considered to be the author of Mahabharata - the longest epic - 200000 verses long (1.5~2k p.). One of the ideas in the book - Karma Yoga - to do things without the thought of doing it. It's a focus towards being disattached from the results and rather focus on the process, the pure enjoyment of it. Bhagavad Gita, a part of this epic, contains a discourse between Lord Krishna and a warrior Arjuna, hwere Kirshna explains the three gunas. All living beings and nature are composed of various portions of the gunas. Sattva: purity, balance, harmony (wisdom, knowledge, goodness) - when it dominates, such individuals are calm, compassionate. Rajas: activity, energy - when it dominates, such individuals are driven by desires and str impulsive. Tamas: inertia, darkness - when it dominates, such individuals are lazy, unmotivated.</span>

               The garden of life. Human growing like a flower, blooming when self-developing. The simplicity of life, self-sufficiency. Happiness is the absence of pain. He gathered people into his house and taught the beauty of life, the need of tending to your environment and oneself. Unlike stoics, he promoted living in a small group of people in a garden, using the 2nd friendship - utility. Enjoying the moment originates from him. Epicuriasm is sometimes associated (falsely) with lavish lifestyles, excessive drinking and other pleasures which are pleasant, but not long term.

               Philosophical questions are meaningless, unless they in itself bring practical value. Pragmatic philosophy. Words are an innacurate representation of the world. The world is actually expressed through people. Truth is value (gain). Radically empirical, meaning that even preminisions and other things that science cannot explain shouldn't be rejected, rather we should look for a new science to explain it. We cherry pick things we want to experience.
